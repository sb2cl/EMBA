# EMBA
Software for modeling and simulation of a TF-based extended metabolic biosensor with an antithetic integral controller.
Including 4 matlab files:
model.m implements the ODEs of the whole system with the Antithetic controller.
model_cI_repressor.m implements the ODEs of the whole system with the Direct controller (this is to perform the comparison between the direct controller and the proposed one with the Antithetic)
parameters.m is a function to define the structure p with the model marameters.
